# disARM

Ever had to re-do the same janky bit extractions and then look it up in the arm docs over and over and over and over again? Fear no more!


For testing, you can use the values extracted from an Apple iPhone 5S (Apple A7 SoC):

```
"ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1":     0x11021
"ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1":	0x1110
"ID_AA64PFR0_EL1":	0x1012
"ID_AA64PFR1_EL1":	0x0
"CLIDR_EL1":            0x9200023
"MIDR_EL1":		0x611f0011
```
